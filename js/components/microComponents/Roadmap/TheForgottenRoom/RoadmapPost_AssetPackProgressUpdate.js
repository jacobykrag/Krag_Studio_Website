    <strong>What's Happening Right Now:</strong> Fine-tuning and making things awesome!
    <br>
    Alright, so here’s the deal—I originally planned to have this asset pack wrapped up by now,
    but I’m pushing it back by <strong>two weeks</strong>.
    Not because of delays, but because I want this to be <strong>really good</strong>. No
    half-finished assets here—only solid, polished models that are <strong>actually ready to
        drop into your projects</strong>.
        <div class="divider"></div>
    <br>

    <strong>🛠️ Geometry & Polycount Tweaks:</strong>
    Every model is getting that <strong>final cleanup</strong>. No unnecessary edges, no weird
    shading—just <strong>clean topology</strong> that looks smooth and works great in real-time.
    I’m keeping things <strong>optimized but detailed</strong>, because performance matters.

    <br>

    <strong>🎨 UV Unwrapping & Seam Placement:</strong>
    UV mapping is one of those things that people don’t talk about enough, but it makes all the
    difference. I’m making sure:
    - <strong>Seams are placed smartly</strong> (aka, you won’t see them in obvious places).
    - <strong>No UV stretching</strong>, so your textures stay crisp.
    - <strong>UV islands are packed efficiently</strong> to make the best use of space.

    <br>

    <strong>📏 Texel Density & Texture Resolutions:</strong>
    I’m keeping texture quality <strong>consistent</strong> across all models. No weird jumps
    between blurry and sharp details—just smooth, balanced texel density.
    Testing different <strong>1K, 2K, and 4K textures</strong> to ensure assets fit different
    needs—whether it's for <strong>performance-focused</strong> or <strong>high-detail</strong> projects.
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <br>

    <strong>🖌️ PBR Texturing & Material Setup:</strong>
    This is where things start to come to life. Every model is getting a proper <strong>PBR
        workflow</strong> setup—meaning materials will react realistically to light.
    - <strong>Smart Material IDs</strong> are making it easy to tweak and customize.
    - <strong>Texture maps are balanced</strong> to avoid overcomplicated shaders.
    - <strong>Everything looks solid under different lighting conditions</strong>.
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <br>

    <strong>📂 Final Export & Engine Compatibility:</strong>
    Before I call this pack finished, I’m making sure:
    - <strong>Everything is properly scaled</strong> and true to real-world sizes.
    - <strong>Pivot points are correctly placed</strong> (no weird rotations when importing).
    - <strong>It works seamlessly in Unreal & Unity</strong> without extra fixes.
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <br>

    <strong>🔜 What's Next?</strong>
    Right now, it’s all about refining the last details. This extra time lets me push the
    quality further without rushing the final result.
    I want these assets to be <strong>plug & play</strong> for you—so when you drop them into
    your project, they just work.
