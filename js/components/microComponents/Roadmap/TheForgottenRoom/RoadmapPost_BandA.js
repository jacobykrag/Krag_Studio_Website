                        <strong>Progress Update:</strong> Before & After! ðŸ”„ <br>
                        Last time, I mentioned taking a bit more time to refine my upcoming asset pack, now officially
                        named <strong>The Forgotten Room!</strong>
                        <div class="divider"></div><br>
                        Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at whatâ€™s been happening behind the scenes: <br><br>
                        âœ” <strong>Polygon count?</strong> Cut in half while keeping every essential detail. <br>
                        âœ” <strong>Texel density?</strong> Optimized for sharper, more consistent textures. <br>
                        âœ” <strong>Material work?</strong> Improved shading, lighting, and wear details for a more
                        authentic look. <br>
                        âœ” <strong>Overall improvements?</strong> Cleaner geometry, better UVs, and assets that are now
                        even more
                        game-ready. <br>
                        <div class="divider"></div><br>
                        Each asset has been <strong>carefully refined</strong> to balance <strong>performance</strong>
                        and <strong>visual quality</strong>, making sure
                        everything feels <strong>polished</strong> and <strong>optimized.</strong> Swipe through the
                        images to see the <strong>before-and-after
                                transformations!</strong> ðŸ‘€
                        <div class="divider"></div><br>
                        Iâ€™m still making <strong>steady progress</strong>, and I canâ€™t wait to share even more soon.
                        Thanks for following
                        along, <strong>your support truly means a lot!</strong> ðŸš€
