            <p class="description">
                Hi, Iâ€™m Jacob Krag. ðŸ‘‹ My passion for 3D art lies in the ability to create something that tells a story, no matter how small the detail. Iâ€™ve always been drawn to the process of shaping ideas into visual experiences, helping to create worlds that feel alive and immersive.

                My work focuses on producing 3D assets that are not only visually appealing but also practical and efficient to use. I approach every project as a collaboration, ensuring the end result reflects your vision while also standing out for its quality and attention to detail.

            <p class="description">
                When Iâ€™m not working, Iâ€™m often playing games, exploring unique worlds, and finding new ways to be inspired. This connection to storytelling and creativity fuels my drive to push boundaries with every project.
